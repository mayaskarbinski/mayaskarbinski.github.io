## Building the molecular cloud population: the role of cloud mergers
As an undergraduate, I started working with Professor Alyssa Goodman and Dr. Sarah Jeffreson at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I studied the role of mergers in building the molecular cloud population of a Milky Way-like galaxy, using outputs from a high-resolution simulation in the moving-mesh code Arepo. The influence of mergers has mostly been studied in the context of triggered star formation. However, the “slow” mergers seen in our simulation are too slow to cause such shockwaves, and therefore have not been studied as extensively. I found that the major effect of these mergers is to aggregate molecular mass into higher-mass clouds with higher densities, higher internal velocity dispersions, and higher instantaneous star formation efficiencies than their unmerged, lower-mass precursors. I am the first author of a paper that was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and I presented my work at the AAS conference in January 2023. The paper is available [here.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.1887S/abstract)
