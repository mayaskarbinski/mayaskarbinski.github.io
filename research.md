## Using Recently Quenched High-redshift Galaxies to Study Galaxy Evolution
Currently, I am studying how high-redshift galaxies “quench,” or stop star formation, with advisors Dr. Kate Rowlands, Dr. Katey Alatalo, and Professor Tim Heckman.

## A JWST Library of Galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions
I wrote my senior thesis with Professor Daniel Eisenstein and Dr. Ben Johnson using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I constructed a carefully curated library of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which will be needed for photometric redshift templates and other SED references.

## Building the molecular cloud population: the role of cloud mergers

As an undergraduate, I worked with Professor Alyssa Goodman and Dr. Sarah Jeffreson at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I studied the role of mergers in building the molecular cloud population of a Milky Way-like galaxy, using outputs from a high-resolution simulation in the moving-mesh code Arepo. <!-- The influence of mergers has mostly been studied in the context of triggered star formation. However, the “slow” mergers seen in our simulation are too slow to cause such shockwaves, and therefore have not been studied as extensively. I found that the major effect of these mergers is to aggregate molecular mass into higher-mass clouds with higher densities, higher internal velocity dispersions, and higher instantaneous star formation efficiencies than their unmerged, lower-mass precursors. + text + --> I am the first author of a paper that was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and I presented my work at the AAS conference in January 2023. The paper is available [here.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.1887S/abstract)
