My name is Maya Skarbinski, and Iâ€™m a first-year graduate student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. I am fascinated by how galaxies stop star formation and am currently studying recently quenched galaxies at high redshifts with advisors Dr. Kate Rowlands, Dr. Katey Alatalo and Professor Tim Heckman.
